![screenshot](images/20260215101059.png)

A lightweight utility for Android TV and Android phones that gives you a **1-click UI** to connect/disconnect Bluetooth devices, or complete **ADB automation** support.

## Features

- **1-Click Connect:** Simple UI to instantly toggle connections from your TV or Phone.
- **Auto-Connect on Launch:** Automatically connect to your designated default or most recent Bluetooth device upon launching the app.
- **Battery Percentage Display:** Real-time battery indicator on device cards with dynamic health status color coding.
- **Safe Startup Volume:** Automatically set headphone media volume to a comfortable level (e.g. 30%, 40%, 50%) upon connection to protect your hearing.
- **Remote Button Mapping (QuickConnect):** Map any button on your Shield/TV remote (via Button Mapper) directly to `QuickConnectActivity` to connect headphones in the background without opening the main UI.
- **Mobile Quick Settings Tile & Widget:** Pull down the notification shade or tap a 1x1 Home Screen widget to toggle connection on Android phones and tablets.
- **ADB Automation:** Trigger connections/disconnections via terminal or automation scripts (Tasker, Home Assistant).
- **Recent Sorting:** Automatically sorts paired devices by most recently used.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across Android TV, Google TV, and Android mobile (Android 8.0+).
- **Low Overhead:** Minimal impact on system resources and stays ready across restarts.

## Usage

### UI Method
Simply launch the **AndroidTV Bluetooth Controller** app:
- **Connect / Disconnect:** Click any paired device card.
- **Set as Default:** Long-click any device card to mark it as the default auto-connect device (indicated by a `★ DEFAULT` badge).
- **Auto-Connect Toggle:** Use the left panel card to enable or disable automatic connection on startup.
- **Safe Startup Volume:** Click the volume card on the left panel to cycle volume presets (`OFF`, `30%`, `40%`, `50%`, `60%`, `70%`, `80%`).

### Quick Connect (Remote Button Mapping)
You can map a button on your Shield or Android TV remote using **Button Mapper**:
- **Option 1 (App / Activity):** In Button Mapper, select **Applications > Quick Connect Bluetooth** (`com.saihgupr.btcontrol/.QuickConnectActivity`).
- **Option 2 (ADB / Intent Action):**
  ```bash
  adb shell am start -n com.saihgupr.btcontrol/.QuickConnectActivity
  ```
  *This instantly connects to your default/recent device in the background and closes cleanly without interrupting your playback.*

### Mobile Quick Settings & Widget
- **Quick Settings Tile:** Edit your Quick Settings shade on your phone and add the **BT Quick Connect** tile for 1-tap connection toggle and live battery status.
- **Home Screen Widget:** Long-press your home screen, select Widgets, and add the **Bluetooth Controller** 1x1 widget.

### ADB Method (Automation)

Connect or disconnect your Bluetooth devices by sending broadcast intents. This is perfect for mapping to remote buttons (via Button Mapper) or integrating into "Movie Mode" scenes.

### Connect a Device

**By Name (Recommended):**
```bash
adb shell am broadcast -a com.saihgupr.btcontrol.ACTION_CONNECT \
  -n com.saihgupr.btcontrol/.BluetoothControlReceiver \
  -e name "Your Device Name"
```
*Note: Name matching is case-insensitive (e.g., "LE_WH-1000XM4").*

**By MAC Address:**
```bash
adb shell am broadcast -a com.saihgupr.btcontrol.ACTION_CONNECT \
  -n com.saihgupr.btcontrol/.BluetoothControlReceiver \
  -e address "CC:98:8B:F4:97:BA"
```

### Disconnect a Device

```bash
adb shell am broadcast -a com.saihgupr.btcontrol.ACTION_DISCONNECT \
  -n com.saihgupr.btcontrol/.BluetoothControlReceiver \
  -e name "Your Device Name"
```


## Installation

### 1. Download & Install APK
Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/saihgupr/AndroidTVBluetooth/releases) page.

**Option A: Via ADB (Fastest)**
```bash
adb install -r path/to/AndroidTVBluetooth.apk
```

**Option B: Manual (No PC needed)**
1. Transfer the APK to your TV (using a USB drive or a "Send Files to TV" app).
2. Open your TV's **File Explorer** and select the APK to install.
3. If prompted, allow "Install from Unknown Sources".

### 2. Grant Permissions
**Option A: Via ADB**
```bash
adb shell pm grant com.saihgupr.btcontrol android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT
```

**Option B: Manual (On TV)**
1. Go to your TV's **Settings > Apps > See all apps**.
2. Find **AndroidTV Bluetooth Controller**.
3. Select **Permissions** and ensure **Nearby Devices** (Bluetooth) is allowed.

### 3. Initialize
Launch the **AndroidTVBluetooth** app manually on your TV **one time** to move it out of the system's "stopped" state. You can close it immediately after.

### Alternative: Build from Source
If you prefer to build it yourself:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/AndroidTVBluetooth.apk
```

## Troubleshooting

If connection fails, check `logcat` to see which devices the TV detects:
```bash
adb logcat -d | grep "BtManagerHelper"
```
This will print a list of paired devices if your specified name was not found.
